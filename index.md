## Overview
The Engage Manoa website is a centralized directory open to UH Manoa students looking for organizations and clubs. UH Manoa is home to many clubs and student organizations. but there isn't currently a way to browse the different clubs digitally. The only option is the google spreadsheet which lists all of UH Manoa's registered independent organizations. Engage Manoa will be designed to offer an easily accessible online space for students to find up-to-date information regarding all campus organizations and clubs. Users can create a profile and have access to a full directory to find a club or organization based on their interests.

The website uses
- Meteor - for server and client code
- React - for UI implementation
- Semantic UI - CSS Framework
- Digital Ocean - for hosting and deployment

## Development
### [Milestone 1](https://github.com/engage-manoa/engage-manoa/projects/1)
The focus of the first milestone was to establish the main structure of the site.
We decided to put off working on aesthetics until we have completed the main core functionality of the site.

### [Milestone 2](https://github.com/engage-manoa/engage-manoa/projects/2)
Milestone 2 focused on expanding the features of the site. Specifically the club search functionality and adding clubs to your my club page.

### [Milestone 3](https://github.com/engage-manoa/engage-manoa/projects/3)
Milestone 3 focused on updating the UI of the site as well as polishing a few features based on feedback.

## Community Feedback
We gathered some feedback on the site from multiple members of the UH Manoa student body. We asked questions focusing on the: usability, UI, usefulness, and ways to improve the site. From there, we used the feedback to made changes to the UI and overall application. Most of the complaints for UI was directed towards many of the clubs missing bits of data. This shouldn't be a problem as the site is designed so the club admin maintains their own clubs info (so most entries on the prototype are missing photos' and descriptions).

The general consensus was the site was intuitive and was easy to understand (scored 4.6/5 on average for user friendliness). All of the participants thought that it would help them find clubs they would be interested in.

## Developer Guide
### Installation
First, click the "Clone or download" button to download the GitHup rep to your local file system.

Second, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Next, cd into the app/ directory of your local copy of the repo, and install third party libraries with:

```
$ meteor npm install
```
### Viewing the app

Once the libraries are installed, you can run the application by invoking the "start" script in the [package.json file](https://github.com/engage-manoa/engage-manoa/blob/main/app/package.json):

```
$ meteor npm run start
```
The first time you run the app, it will create some default data. Once everything is running, your command prompt should display:

```
=> Started your app.

=> App running at: http://localhost:3000/
   Type Control-C twice to stop.
```
The running application will appear in your web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can either login using the credentials in [settings.development.json](https://github.com/engage-manoa/engage-manoa/blob/main/config/settings.development.json) under "defaultAccounts", or you can sign up and create your own account in the app.

### Loading the default data

There is default data that is stored in JSON format in [settings.development.json](https://github.com/engage-manoa/engage-manoa/blob/main/config/settings.development.json) under "defaultClubs". This data is loaded into the database upon startup. Additionally, you can load data from a CSV file that is stored as [rio.csv](https://github.com/engage-manoa/engage-manoa/blob/main/app/private/rio.csv). Note that the headers of this CSV file must be: clubName, category, Contact person, Admin, test.
The CSV used for the defaultClubs was from the [UH MƒÅnoa Approved RIOs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vK_ixq3a86uXjHXy9oNnyYHwAvyU9smNPKuJU6OYd-Q/edit#gid=94293836) entry for 2020-2021.
